# General

## Running terminal commands

- Always check if the app you need is already running on localhost:[3000-3005]
  - The Governance App is usually running on localhost:3002
- Run apps via `turbo dev --filter <app-name-as-defined-in-package-json>`, but only do so after you confirmed there's no existing local server running ont that port
- Use turbo's `--filter` flag whenever possible to avoid wasting resources. I.e., when asked to make changes in the reserve.mento.org app, run `turbo dev --filter reserve.mento.org` (and NOT `turbo dev` which would start every server for every project)

## After making changes

Always test your changes by doing at least the following:

- Run `turbo check-types` to confirm the TypeScript build still works
- Run `trunk check --fix` to confirm our linters are still passing
- Confirm your changes actually work by checking the edited page on localhost (you can get the right port from looking at the respective "dev" script in package.json, i.e. when developing app.mento.org you'd check the "dev" script in `./apps/app.mento.org/package.json` for the port etc.)

## Node and Package Manager Versions

Please refer to the main `./package.json` to see what Node and Package Manager versions this project uses.
