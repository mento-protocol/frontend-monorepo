- Always follow Vercel’s Web Interface Guidelines:
  - https://vercel.com/design/guidelines
  - Pay particular attention to: keyboard operability, clear focus styles, URL-as-state, optimistic updates, and forms/validation behavior.

- When editing UI code:
  - Prefer semantic HTML and native elements before ARIA.
  - Ensure forms follow the “Don’t block typing”, “Don’t pre-disable submit”, and error-placement rules.
  - For async states, keep button labels and add loading indicators with minimum visible duration.
