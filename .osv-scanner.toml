# GHSA-5f7q-jpqc-wp7h: Next.js Unbounded Memory Consumption via PPR Resume Endpoint
# Suppressed because we do not use PPR (Partial Prerendering) — it is an experimental
# opt-in feature and is not enabled in any of our next.config files.
# No stable 15.x patch exists; fix requires 15.6.0-canary.61+ or Next 16.1.5+.
