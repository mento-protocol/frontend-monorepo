# Mento Frontend Monorepo

## Audit Team

When the user says **"Spin up the audit team"** (or similar: "start the audit", "run the audit agents", "launch audit team"):

1. Read the full agent specifications from the `audit-team.md` file in your auto-memory directory
2. Launch **Tier 1 agents (1-4) in parallel** using the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
3. Each agent should **read files, analyze, and produce a findings report** with severity ratings
4. After Tier 1 completes, launch **Tier 2 (Agent 5)** which consumes all Tier 1 findings and produces a consolidated report
5. Present the consolidated findings and ask the user which issues to fix

The audit covers three codebases:

- `apps/app.mento.org` — Main DeFi app
- `packages/web3` — Shared web3 hooks and transaction logic
- `../mento-sdk` — Mento protocol SDK (external, relative to monorepo root)

The SDK repo is external at `../mento-sdk` — agents auditing it should read but NOT modify files there unless explicitly told to.
