# GHSA-5f7q-jpqc-wp7h: Next.js Unbounded Memory Consumption via PPR Resume Endpoint
# Suppressed because we do not use PPR (Partial Prerendering) — it is an experimental
# opt-in feature and is not enabled in any of our next.config files.
# No stable 15.x patch exists; fix requires 15.6.0-canary.61+ or Next 16.1.5+.

# GHSA-848j-6mx2-7j84: Elliptic uses a cryptographic primitive with a risky implementation (CVE-2025-14505)
# Transitive dependency via @ethersproject/signing-key (ethers v5). No patched version of
# elliptic exists yet. The flaw involves incorrect ECDSA 'k' byte-length computation; practical
# risk is low since we only use ethers for client-side read operations and contract interactions,
# not server-side key signing.
